Q1) What is UseEffect hook?
Ans:-
------
    useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component with an external system.

***Connecting to an external system

    Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. 
    These systems aren’t controlled by React, so they are called external.
