Q)1 What is SOLID Principle?
Ans:- 
SOLID principle is an acronym that stands for 5 key principles in software development: 

S – Single Responsibility Principle 
O – Open Closed Principle 
L – Liskov Substitution Principle
I – Interface Segregation Principle
D – Dependency Inversion Principle

It has become one of the key principles in modern software development to ensure the code is using these SOLID principles.
Following are the advantages that offer while using SOLID principles in your software development.

-   Helps developers to break down complex problems into smaller manageable pieces.
-   Helps developers to reduce the dependencies on code so that in the future if any one area of the code changes,
    it won’t impact the other area of the code.
-   Helps developers to move tightly coupled code or components into a loosely coupled, flexible, and maintainable manner.


a) Single Responsibility Principle

As the name suggests, the Single Responsibility principle states 2 key principles.

a) Your class or method should have only one reason to change.
b) Your class or method should have only one responsibility to take care of.

Imagine a baker who is responsible for baking bread. The baker’s role is to focus on the task of baking bread, 
ensuring that the bread is of high quality, properly baked, and meets the bakery’s standards.
However, if the baker is also responsible for managing the inventory, ordering supplies, serving customers, 
and cleaning the bakery, this would violate the SRP.Each of these tasks represents a separate responsibility,
and by combining them, the baker’s focus and effectiveness in baking bread could be compromised.
To adhere to the SRP, the bakery could assign different roles to different individuals or teams. 
For example, there could be a separate person or team responsible for managing the inventory, another for ordering supplies, 
another for serving customers, and another for cleaning the bakery.

class BreadBaker{
    public void bakeBreak(){
        system.out.println("Baking high quality bread");
    }
}

class inventoryManager{
    public void manageInventory(){
        system.out.println("Managing inventory");
    }
}

class SupplyOrder{
    public void orderSupplies(){
        System.out.println("Ordering supplies...");
    }
}


public class BakeryManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        BreadBaker baker = new BreadBaker();
        inventoryManager inventoryManager = new InventoryManager();
        SupplyOrder supplyOrder = new SupplyOrder();
    

        //each class focuses on its specific responsibility

        baker.bakeBread();
        inventoryManager.manageInventory();
        supplyOrder.orderSupplies();
    }
}

b) Open/Closed Principle

This principle states that “Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

Let’s understand Open/Closed Principle using an example:

-   Imagine you have a class called PaymentProcessor that processes payments for an online store. 
Initially, the PaymentProcessor class only supports processing payments using credit cards. However, 
you want to extend its functionality to also support processing payments using PayPal.

Instead of modifying the existing PaymentProcessor class to add PayPal support, you can create a new class called PayPalPaymentProcessor 
that extends the PaymentProcessor class. This way, the PaymentProcessor class remains closed for modification but open for extension,
adhering to the Open-Closed Principle. Let’s understand this through the code implementation.

Interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount); // abstract method
}

class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
   void processPayment(double amount){
    System.out.println("Processing Credit card payment $" + amount);
   }
}

class PayPalPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    void processPayment(double amount){
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment of $" + amount);
    }
}

public class BakeryManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        CreditCardPaymentProcessor creditCardPaymentProcessor = new CreditCardPaymentProcessor();
        PayPalPaymentProcessor payPalPaymentProcessor = new PayPalPaymentProcessor();

        creditCardPaymentProcessor.processPayment(100);
        payPalPaymentProcessor.processPayment(200);


    }
}

c) Liskov’s Substitution Principle
The principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 and according to this principle “Derived or child classes 
must be substitutable for their base or parent classes“. This principle ensures that any class that is the child 
of a parent class should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.

Let’s understand Liskov’s Substitution Principle using an example:

One of the classic examples of this principle is a rectangle having four sides. A rectangle’s height can be any value
and width can be any value. A square is a rectangle with equal width and height. So we can say that we can extend the 
properties of the rectangle class into square class. 


In order to do that you need to swap the child (square) class with parent (rectangle) class to fit the definition of a 
square having four equal sides but a derived class does not affect the behavior of the parent class so if you will do 
that it will violate the Liskov Substitution Principle.

Let’s understand by example

class Rectangle {
    protected double width;
    protected double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height){
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double area(){
        return width * height;
    }

    public double getWidth(){
        return width;
    }

    public double getHeight(){
        return height;
    }
   
     public void setWidth(double width){
        this.width = width; // ensure both and height remain the same;
    }
       @Override
    public void setHeight(double height){
         this.height = height; // ensure both and height remain the same;
    }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    public Square(double size){
        super(size, size);
    }

    @Override
    public void setWidth(double width){
        this.width = this.height = width; // ensure both and height remain the same;
    }

    @Override
    public void setHeight(double height){
        this.width = this.height = height; // ensure both and height remain the same;
    }
    
}

public class ShapeDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Square square = new Square(5.0);
        square.setWidth(6.0);

        System.out.println("New Width and height of square: " + square.getWidth() + ", " + square.getHeight());
        System.out.println("area of square" + square.area());
    }
}

d) Interface Segregation Principle
This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar
to the single responsibility principle. It states that “do not force any client to implement an interface which
is irrelevant to them“. Here your main goal is to focus on avoiding fat interface and give preference to many small 
client-specific interfaces. You should prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and each interface should have a specific responsibility.

Let’s understand Interface Segregation Principle using an example:

-- Suppose you have a Store interface 

public interface Store {
    public void Save();
    public void Delete();
    public void Update();
    public void Fetch();
    public void AddKey();
    public void RemoveKey();
}

Now suppose you have a class called DBStore that implements Store interface and also contains extra methods

public Class DBStore implements Store{

    @Override
    public void Save(){

    }

    @Override
    public void Delete(){

    }

    @Override
    public void Update(){

    }

    @Override 
    public void Fetch(){

    }

    public void AddKey(){

    }

    public void RemoveKey(){

    }

}

Now suppose you have CacheStore class  that implements Store interface, but here is problems that CacheStore only needs of AddKey() and
RemoveKey() methods but since it is implementing Store interface all methods needs to implements that is violating principle of Interface
Segregation and it is make Store interface fat.

Now solution is that we can create two interface DBStore Interface and CacheStore Interface

Interface DBStore {
     public void Save();
    public void Delete();
    public void Update();
    public void Fetch();
}

Interface CacheStore {
    AddKey();
    RemoveKey();
}

class DBStoreService implement DBStore {
      @Override
    public void Save(){

    }

    @Override
    public void Delete(){

    }

    @Override
    public void Update(){

    }

    @Override 
    public void Fetch(){

    }
}

class CacheStoreService implements CacheStore {
    @Override
    public void AddKey(){

    }

    @Override
    public void RemoveKey(){

    }
}


In this way we have segregate the interfaces.


e) Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is a principle in object-oriented design that states that “High-level modules 
should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions“. Additionally, abstractions should not depend
on details(implementation). Details(implementation) should depend on abstractions.

In simpler terms, the DIP suggests that classes should rely on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) rather
than concrete implementations.
This allows for more flexible and decoupled code, making it easier to change implementations without affecting other parts 
of the codebase.

example:-
    Suppose we have three classes A,B,C.  class A depends on class B, class B Depends on class C.
    If changes happens in class C it will hamper class B, if class B changes it will hampler class A. it is the problem.
    another problem is that if you write unit test cases because class A is dependent on class B somehow you need to mock
    class B, and since class B dependent on class C you, somehow you need to mock class C. means it is difficult to manage, 
    diffcult to change and diffcult to test.

    class A  extends B{
        field : type
        method(type) : type
    }

    class B  extends C{
        field: type
        method(type) : type
    }

    class C {
        field : type 
        method(type) : type
    }

    for this we will implement Dependency Inversion principle.

    To solve this problem Let’s introduce an Interface called Interface B and Interface C, and interface B depends on interface C

    Interface B  extends C{
        field: type
        method(type) : type
    }
    Interface C {
          field: type
        method(type) : type
    }

    class A implements B{
          field: type
        method(type) : type
    }

    class B implements B{
          field: type
        method(type) : type
    }

    class C implements C{
          field: type
        method(type) : type
    }


Let’s understand with real world example. I am taking example from Interface Segregation principle:-
    public class  CacheStore {
        
        public void AddKey(String key, String value){

        }

        public void RemoveKey(String key){

        }

        public void EvictKey(){

        }
    }

    

    public class UserProfile {
        CacheStore cacheStore = new CacheStore();
        cacheStore.AddKey("arpit", "male");
    }

 in this example class UserProfile directly using cacheStoreService class, if in future if will change the AddKey() method in any case 
 then i need to change in UserProfile class as well because it depends on cacheStoreService.
   
   public Interface  CacheStore {
        public void AddKey(String key, String value);
        public void RemoveKey(String key);
        public void EvictKey();
    }

    public class  CacheStoreService implements CacheStore {
        @Override
        public void AddKey(String key, String value){

        }

        @Override
        public void RemoveKey(String key){

        }

        @Override
        public void EvictKey(){

        }
    }
    public class UserProfile {
          CacheStore cacheStore = new CacheStore();
        cacheStore.AddKey("arpit", "male");
    }
 instead of that we can simply implement from interface and use it. So that implementation of these methods can be changed internaly 
 without changing CacheStore interface.
